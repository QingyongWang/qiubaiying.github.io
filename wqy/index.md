<h4>About Me:</h4> 
		
 I received M.Sc. and B.Eng. degrees both in Computer Science and Technology. My research falls in the field of data mining and machine learning. I am interested in exploring and exploiting the big data for both building understanding and user modeling. The very recent works focus on integrate biometrics and data mining applications. </p>

			<B>In 2014s  The Ministry of Education National Undergraduate Training Programs for Innovation and Entrepreneurship </B><br>
Topic name: Intelligent Investment Model based on Big Data Analysis（201411600003）<br>
Description: Based on the "big data" opinion mining, we did systematic information collection, information analysis and created a investment stock index investment model, aiming to analyze the mass of news and information, so as to forecast the stock index trend for better guidance of the investment decisions. Multivariate regression was made so as to obtain the predictive function through news on domestic economy, global markets and policies direction which were tested as the most significant to the index fluctuations.<p>
